## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**  
  Collects data from:
  - Soil moisture sensor
  - Water level sensor
  - Temperature & humidity sensors

- **Wireless Data Transmission**  
  - Arduino processes sensor data
  - Sends data to NodeMCU via serial
  - NodeMCU communicates with a Node.js server using WebSocket

- **Smart Decision Making**  
  - Fetches weather forecasts using Weather API
  - AI automation mode decides pump operation based on:
    - Soil moisture
    - Weather forecast
  - Manual override available via web app
